After the live lecture component, L2D holds a second live stream on the same day at 15:00 GMT/BST for one hour, whereby students can work through the DIY exercise examples found in the written materials for the lesson topic at hand, together with L2D academics and tutors. It must be stressed that these sessions are restricted solely to the fortnightly lesson topic: learners with wider queries are encouraged to submit requests via the tutor support session booking system outlined in section 8 of this handbook. 
 
You can bring your own questions, share your screen with us, and we will collectively debug and help you with your code. This provides a unique live space for you to have your questions answered, and ensure you have a thorough understanding of the subject material. These workshops are not recorded, and are only accessible to those who attend at the advertised time, as confirmed in your lesson release email.
