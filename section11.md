## Certificate of Completion

Once you have completed the L2D course, you will receive a certificate of completion. You are required to have submitted all bar one assignment for each component of the course in order to be awarded a certificate of completion. Three out of four Basic Python assignments must be submitted; three out of four Data Handling assignments must be submitted; four out of five Machine Learning assignments must be submitted, and for those who have taken all of the aforementioned units as a Complete Course package, you must submit your final project. You will then be awarded a certificate for each completed component, together with an overall course completion certificate for learners who have taken the entire course.
