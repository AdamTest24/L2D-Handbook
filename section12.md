## Ways to get in-touch

There are a multitude of ways that you can reach the staff at L2D.  
 
1. If your query is academic, we recommend posting it (with as much information as possible) on the **GitHub Discussions** forum.  

2. You can reach tutors for direct 1-to-1 support, by booking a support session, as outlined in section 8 of this handbook. 

3. If your query relates directly to a marked assignment, you can submit a pull request, in direct response to the feedback comment left for you by your tutor under the **Pull Requests** menu, at the top of your GitHub repository page. 

4. If you have more general course queries please contact admin@learntodiscover.ai via email, and if queries are academic in nature, they will be forwarded to the relevant course academic.
