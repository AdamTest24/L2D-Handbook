## Practice on your dataset

For learners who have completed the entire L2D course (inclusive of Basic Python, Data Handling and Machine Learning modules), you are given roughly four subsequent weeks to complete and submit a Final Project. You can use data of your choosing, or one of the provided datasets to complete your Final Project, and the deadline for submission is advertised in the L2D Course Calendar (and in your last lesson release email for Machine Learning lesson 6).  
 
The point of this project is to make use of techniques across the breadth of the entire L2D course to analyse the data, and write this up into a complete Jupyter Notebook. These will be graded within a further month of submission, and successful completion of your Final Project will result in you achieving a Certificate of Completion for the L2D course. 
 
Tutor support is available for anyone who requires it during the writing of your Final Project, and can be booked using the Tutor Support Session booking procedure, outlined previously in this handbook.
