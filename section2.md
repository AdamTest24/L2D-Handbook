The L2D course is run on a largely fortnightly schedule, with new lesson topics being made available to you on Mondays, excluding public holidays and closure periods. The dates of these lesson releases are provided in the L2D calendar [LINK HERE] and it is recommended that you transfer important dates into your own personal calendar, so that you donâ€™t miss any key aspects of your learning with L2D.  
 
Each lesson release is marked by the receipt of a lesson release email (routinely issued on Mondays) that will contain all information required to access L2D materials and available resources. Please keep an eye open for these, and check that they do not get caught in your junk mail.
