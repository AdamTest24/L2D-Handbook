## Submitting Course Feedback

After each live lecture, we ask that students complete a [feedback form](https://forms.gle/bunnSbCfee9DEHyT6), which helps us to gauge your level of satisfaction with each fortnight of learning offered on L2D. The form takes a few short minutes to complete, and gives us a valuable opportunity to learn what you like about the course, as well as any suggestions for improvements that you might have for us. 
 
We pride ourselves on our agility to act on your suggestions as fast as possible here at L2D, and highly value the relationships that we develop with our learners. The feedback form is linked [here](https://forms.gle/bunnSbCfee9DEHyT6).
