<p>We would firstly likely to extend our warmest welcome to you, and
thank you for choosing the L2D course to empower you with valuable
skills in Python programming, data science and machine learning:
developed by life scientists, for life scientists.</p>
<p>In order to get started, you will need to register yourself for a
GitHub account. Our administrators will then issue you with a <a href="https://forms.gle/V4X3GfNMEUBbJgFn8" class="external-link">Registration Form</a> for us
to collect your GitHub handles, and we will follow shortly with an
invitation requesting that you join a GitHub Organisation for the
current cohort of learners.</p>
<p>Once this has been set up, please keep a note of your GitHub login
details, as these will be used throughout your L2D course to access
materials, submit assignments and interact with academics and fellow
learners.</p>

<div class="callout-content">
<p>Owned by Microsoft, GitHub is an international community-based
organisation that provides a suite of facilities to create, edit, share
and publish code. At L2D, we have made a conscious decision to employ
GitHub’s infrastructure within our course, in order to initiate new
users into the world of GitHub so that – should you continue to explore
coding further after the course – you will already be familiar with one
of the leading, internationally-recognised platforms and standards for
programmers and coders, across the world. This also facilitates
enjoining in our community of L2D learners and tutors via GitHub
Discussions: a forum for posting questions, sharing ideas and new
findings. We also make use of GitHub Classroom: an arm of GitHub
Education that allows us to manage your learning journey on L2D.</p>

<p>The L2D course is run on a largely fortnightly schedule, with new
lesson topics being made available to you on Mondays, excluding public
holidays and closure periods. The dates of these lesson releases are
provided in the <a href="../fig/L2D_Calendar_July_24.pdf">L2D calendar</a>
and it is recommended that you transfer important dates into your own
personal calendar, so that you don’t miss any key aspects of your
learning with L2D.</p>
<p>Each lesson release is marked by the receipt of a lesson release
email (routinely issued on Mondays) that will contain all information
required to access L2D materials and available resources. Please keep an
eye open for these, and check that they do not get caught in your junk
mail.</p></section><section id="aio-section3"><p>Content from <a href="section3.html">Lesson Portal</a></p>

<p>After the live lecture component, L2D holds a second live stream on
the same day at 15:00 GMT/BST for one hour, whereby students can work
through the DIY exercise examples found in the written materials for the
lesson topic at hand, together with L2D academics and tutors. It must be
stressed that these sessions are restricted solely to the fortnightly
lesson topic: learners with wider queries are encouraged to submit
requests via the tutor support session booking system outlined in
section 8 of this handbook.</p>
<p>You can bring your own questions, share your screen with us, and we
will collectively debug and help you with your code. This provides a
unique live space for you to have your questions answered, and ensure
you have a thorough understanding of the subject material. These
workshops are not recorded, and are only accessible to those who attend
at the advertised time, as confirmed in your lesson release email.</p></section><section id="aio-section6"><p>Content from <a href="section6.html">Course Feedback</a></p>

<p>As you progress through the L2D course, you are expected to complete
one assignment per fortnightly lesson release. Assignments are template
Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) files found in your Assignments folder, and
consist of a set of questions related to the fortnight’s lesson topic.
You should complete these with the knowledge you have gained from
consuming L2D’s written materials, tutorial videos, live lectures and
drop-in sessions.</p>
<p>Assignments are due to be submitted before the next lesson topic
release date. For instance, as lessons are released on Mondays, you must
submit them before 00:00, 14 days after. Timely submissions result in
graded assignments and feedback being returned to you within a further
14 days. If you submit an assignment late, it will not be prioritised by
our tutors, and in certain cases, this may affect or delay the issue of
any L2D certificates. If you are facing extenuating circumstances and
require an extension, please let us know by contacting <a href="mailto:admin@learntodiscover.ai" class="email">admin@learntodiscover.ai</a>.</p>

<p>Below are a set of <strong>step-by-step instructions</strong> showing
you how to submit an assignment. At L2D, we make use of GitHub
Codespaces, which allows you to set up an online instance of Microsoft
Visual Studio Code, and code directly from within your web browser. We
recommend the use of <strong>Google Chrome</strong>, for stability and
ease.</p>
<p>Firstly, let’s familiarise ourselves with the
<strong>Assignments</strong> folder, which can be found inside your
lesson repository. The example below shows the Basic Python 1 (BP1)
lesson repository.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/Picture%206.png" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Inside your <strong>Assignments</strong> folder, you will find:</p>
<p>A <strong>ReadMe</strong> file that (as with your main repository
page) is displayed beneath the folder’s contents.</p>
<p>A <strong>Data</strong> folder that contains any data that may or may
not be required to complete the assignment.</p>
<p>A <strong>Feedback</strong> folder, that will contain your marked
assignment, once it has been graded and returned to you.</p>

<li>This will begin setting up a Codespace for you to work in. This may
take several minutes to complete: please be patient. The total time it
takes to set up your Codespace could also be affected by the speed of
your internet connection. If you would like to monitor progress of the
setup, click the blue Building codespace hyperlink at the bottom right
of your screen to display the setup log in the terminal tab.</li>

main view, in the middle of the window. Note: the ReadMe file may open
and come into view – close this tab, and focus on your
assignment.</p></li>
<li><p>Next, you must click on <strong>Select Kernel</strong> on the far
right of the window. A dropdown menu will appear in the middle of the
window: click <strong>Install/Enable suggested extensions</strong>. Wait
a short moment while these install (progress is indicated, bottom

submit your assignment. If you wish to pause working, and come back at a
later time – providing you have a stable and active internet connection

reopen the Codespace you created from your main repository page again,
you will be able to pick up where you left off. To access your Codespace
at a later date, go back to your main repository page, and click the
green Code button. Under the <strong>Codespaces</strong> tab, you will
see any active codespaces that you have in your repository. They will

<li>Once staged you must commit the changes, and add a commit message.
GitHub is based around an efficient version control system, which allows
you to add messages to every change made to a file, and keeps a detailed
history of all changes made, so that you can easily see every version of
a file, at the different stages at which it was worked upon and edited.
Click in the <strong>Message</strong> cell, write down a relevant commit
message (i.e. ‘Assignment completed’), and hit the blue Commit
button.</li>

daunting. But we encourage you to keep this handbook to hand, so that
you can get used to this system of submitting assignments. At L2D, we
have selected this protocol for assignment submission to familiarise
learners with GitHub’s infrastructure so that – for those who pursue
coding in the future – you will be armed with the knowledge of how to
use a platform and system for code sharing, collaboration and
publication that is recognised and used, internationally.</p>

<p>Once your assignment has been marked, it will be returned to your
repository by your L2D tutor within 14 days of timely submission. The
file will have **_MARKED** appended to its title, just before the file
extension, and will be returned to the <strong>Feedback</strong> folder
on your lesson repository. Inside your notebook, you will find comments
initialled by your tutor in your work and code, indicating your
progress. For example, a line commencing with # AL: would indicate that
your tutor (initials AL) is leaving you in-line feedback.</p>
<figure><img src="../fig/Picture%2018.png" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Also inside your Feedback folder, you will see a ReadMe file, which
explains each grade boundary, and how these grades reflect the
application and understanding demonstrated in your work. Your L2D
assignments are assigned one of three grades:
<strong>Distinction</strong>, <strong>Pass</strong> or
<strong>Revise</strong>.</p>
<p>Your L2D tutor will also leave a summary comment on your work, and
grade as a GitHub Pull Request. Once this has been submitted, you will
receive a notification in your GitHub inbox (top right of any GitHub
window), and you will also receive an email to your GitHub-registered
email address, indicating that a Pull Request has been submitted by your
tutor. If you received a Distinction or Pass, no further action is
required, on your behalf. However, should you receive a Revise for your
work, you are expected to re-attempt your assignment, as per your
tutor’s guidance, and re-submit this within 14 days of receiving your
marked assignment.</p>

<li><p>Once you have pushed and submitted your assignment, go back to
the Pull Requests tab, find the Feedback left by your tutor, scroll down
and you will see a blank <strong>Add a comment</strong> field. In this,
reply to your tutor, saying you have revised your assignment, and your
tutor will automatically be notified of your revisions. Please note,
this step is critical. Without it, your tutor won’t be notified that you
have submitted a revised assignment, and will not know to re-mark
this.</p></li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="../fig/Picture%2020.png" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><p>Once your assignment has been revised, it will be returned to you in
the same way, with your tutor adding a comment to the same Pull Request,
culminating in you receiving a notification and email. Once your
assignment has achieved either a Distinction or a Pass, you will not be
required to submit any further revisions.</p>

<p>As previously advised, please be sure to submit your revised
assignment within 14 days of receiving your mark from your tutor.
Delayed assignment and/or revision submissions will not be prioritised
by our tutors, and if the workload for them is high, this may (without
reported extenuating circumstances) result in delayed issuing of
certificates for your completion of the L2D course.</p>

<p>L2D now offers the chance to book a 30-minute, 1-to-1 discussion
between students and tutors. This is aimed at allowing students with
particular queries to have these answered and walked-through with an L2D
tutor. As an example, these queries can either be about a subject area,
assignment question, or final project.</p>
<p>Please refer to this instruction document to help you book sessions
with a tutor of your choice.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click on the following URL (and bookmark it for safekeeping): <a href="https://linktr.ee/L2DTutorSessions" class="external-link uri">https://linktr.ee/L2DTutorSessions</a></p></li>
<li><p>From the list, select a tutor of your choosing to see their
availability. Please note, if one tutor’s availability is not convenient
for you, it’s a good idea to check on the others in the list, for a
wider array of support slots.</p></li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="../fig/Picture%2021.png" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><ol start="3" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Each booking consists of a 30-minute slot. Select a slot that is
convenient for you. Typically, we make slots available one week at a
time.</li>
</ol>
<figure><img src="../fig/Picture%2022.png" class="figure mx-auto d-block"></figure><ol start="4" style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>To book a slot, click the time of your choosing, and fill out the

take place on the automatically provided Google Meet link, which will
allow you to engage in a video meeting with your tutor, directly from
your web browser. No additional software or sign-ups are required.</p>

<p>For learners who have completed the entire L2D course (inclusive of
Basic Python, Data Handling and Machine Learning modules), you are given
roughly four subsequent weeks to complete and submit a Final Project.
You can use data of your choosing, or one of the provided datasets to
complete your Final Project, and the deadline for submission is
advertised in the L2D Course Calendar (and in your last lesson release
email for Machine Learning lesson 6).</p>
<p>The point of this project is to make use of techniques across the
breadth of the entire L2D course to analyse the data, and write this up
into a complete Jupyter Notebook. These will be graded within a further
month of submission, and successful completion of your Final Project
will result in you achieving a Certificate of Completion for the L2D
course.</p>
<p>Tutor support is available for anyone who requires it during the
writing of your Final Project, and can be booked using the Tutor Support
Session booking procedure, outlined previously in this handbook. <!--

<p>Once you have completed the L2D course, you will receive a
certificate of completion. You are required to have submitted all bar
one assignment for each component of the course in order to be awarded a
certificate of completion. Three out of four Basic Python assignments
must be submitted; three out of four Data Handling assignments must be
submitted; four out of five Machine Learning assignments must be
submitted, and for those who have taken all of the aforementioned units
as a Complete Course package, you must submit your final project. You
will then be awarded a certificate for each completed component,
together with an overall course completion certificate for learners who
have taken the entire course. <!--
